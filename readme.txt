Adds a "re-abolish slavery" ribbon to the top left or top right corner of your site, which links to the Not For Sale campaign.


== Description ==
Millions of people are living in slavery around the world today, even though most of us think it was abolished in the 1800s. Slavery has always existed to some degree, but over the last few decades it has grown to become a $5 billion a year industry, making it the most lucrative criminal enterprise in the world behind drug trafficking.

In the United States and every other country in the world, young girls and boys are forced and coerced into child prostitution, and people of all ages are forced to perform various kinds of labor for little or no pay. This is commonly referred to as "[human trafficking](http://www.polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/overview)," and it amounts to modern-day slavery. Traffickers use lies, manipulation, contrived debts, threats, drugs, violence, rape and murder to control victims.

You can help raise awareness by installing this plugin, which will add a ribbon to your website that links to [the Not For Sale campaign](http://www.notforsalecampaign.org). You can view the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/re-abolish-slavery-ribbon/screenshots/) for examples of how it will look.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What should I do if the ribbon isn't showing up? =
Make sure your theme's footer.php calls [wp_footer()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) just before the closing `</body>` tag. If it is, start a post in the support forums (see below for details).

= Will the link open in a new window? =
There is an option to control whether it does or not, but be aware that forcing links to open in a new window [violates web standards](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/01/should-links-open-in-new-windows/). Please consider leaving it off.

= How do I prevent the ribbon from overlapping my header on smartphones or other small screens? =
You can go to the General Settings page and check the 'Move to Bottom on Small Screens' box. That will move the ribbon to the bottom of the page for smartphones and other devices with small screens.

Note that this won't work in Internet Expolorer 8 or below, because they don't support modern web standards.

= Can I make a donation to support the plugin? =
I don't want to take any donations for myself, but if you'd like to give something please consider making a donation to [the Not For Sale campaign](http://www.notforsalecampaign.org) directly, or [buying something from their store](http://www.notforsalestore.com).

= How can I get help when I'm having a problem? =
2. Read the answers on this page.
3. Check [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/re-abolish-slavery-ribbon?forum_id=10), because your problem may already have been answered there, and if not, the answer you get will help others in the future.

If you still need help, then first follow these instructions:

1. Disable all other plugins and switch to the default theme, then check if the problem is still happening. 
2. If it isn't, then the problem may actually be with your theme or other plugins you have installed. 
3. If the problem is still happening, then start a new thread in the forum with a **detailed description** of your problem and **the URL to your site**.
4. Tag the post with `re-abolish-slavery-ribbon` so that I get an e-mail notification. If you use the link above it'll automatically tag it for you.
5. Check the 'Notify me of follow-up posts via e-mail' box so you won't miss any replies.

I monitor the forums and will respond as my schedule permits.

= How can I send feedback that isn't of a support nature? =
You can send me feedback/comments/suggestions using the [contact form](http://iandunn.name/contact) on my website, and I'll respond as my schedule permits. *Please **don't** use this if you're having trouble using the plugin;* use the support forums instead (see above question for details).
